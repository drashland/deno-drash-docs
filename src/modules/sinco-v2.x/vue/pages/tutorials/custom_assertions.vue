  p Sinco provides some utility methods that act as wrappers for Deno's <code>std/testing</code> assertions. These methods will run a query on the DOM and make an assertion. You do not need to assert these yourself.
  p The methods it provides are:
  ul
    li <code>assertUrlIs</code> - This will assert that the URL for the page matches a given parameter
    li <code>assertSee</code> - This method will assert that the given text exists inside the page
  p In this tutorial, you will:
  ul
    li Create a headless browser instance;
    li Assert the url for the page; and
    li Assert text exists inside the DOM (page).

        |   await Sinco.assertSee("Develop With Confidence");
        |   await Sinco.done();
        | })
      p Here you are going to create your headless browser instance, and navigate to <code>https://drash.land</code>. Once the page has loaded, you are going to assert that the page you are on is as expected. You will assert this URL and also assert that you can see some given text on the page, and in this example, it is <code>Develop With Confidence</code>.
