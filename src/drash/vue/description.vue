  p Drash is a REST microframework for Deno's HTTP server with zero dependencies. It is designed to help you build your projects quickly with the ability to scale. You can build:
  ul
    li APIs
    li Web apps (this site is powered by Drash)
    li SPAs (the Drash Land documentation pages are Vue applications)
    li Static HTML sites
  p How you use Drash is up to you, so it can be everything you need and nothing you don't &mdash; like a DRASH tent.
